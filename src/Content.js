  `The Himalayan ecosystem is fragile and diverse. It includes over 51 million people
who practice hill agriculture and remains vulnerable The Himalayan ecosystem is
vital to the ecological security of the Indian landmass, through providing forest
cover, feeding perennial rivers that are the source of drinking water,
irrigation, and hydropower, conserving biodiversity, providing a rich base for
high value agriculture, and spectacular landscapes for sustainable tourism. `,

  `The Himalayan eco system is vulnerable and susceptible to the impacts and
consequences of a) changes on account of natural causes, b) climate change
resulting from anthropogenic emissions and c) developmental paradigms of the
modern society. `,

  `The Himalayas house one of the largest resources of snow and ice and its glaciers
which form a source of fresh water for the perennial rivers such as the Indus,
the Ganga, and the Brahmaputra. Glacial melt may impact their long-term leanseason flows, with adverse impacts on the economy in terms of water
availability and hydropower generation. Recession of Himalayan glaciers will
pose a major danger to the country. Currently available data gathered by
multiples of institutions without a coordinated effort do not indicate systematic
trends of recession of Himalayan glaciers `,

  `The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) has enunciated the launch
of a National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem. The Mission
needs to deliver better understanding of the coupling between the Himalayan
ecosystem and the climate factors and provide inputs for Himalayan Sustainable
development while addressing also the protection of a fragile ecosystem. This
will require the joint effort of climatologists, glaciologists and other experts.
Exchange of information with the South Asian countries and countries sharing the
Himalayan ecology will also be required. There is a need to establish an
observational and monitoring network for the Himalayan environment to assess
freshwater resources and health of the ecosystem.`,

  `Recognizing the importance of scientific and technological inputs required for
sustaining the fragile Himalayan Ecosystem, the Ministry of Science and
Technology has been charged with the nodal responsibility of coordinating this
mission. However, the mission requires valuable cooperation of Indian
Himalayan States, the planning commission and the Ministry of Environment and
Forests to achieve its goals. `,

  `Sustainability of an ecosystem demands a balance and equilibrium among
various forms of life and their surroundings established over long periods of time.
Therefore, the mission recognizes the need for creation and building of national
capacities to observe and respond to changes in a sustainable manner. The
mission proposes a coordinated effort in identification and strengthening of
institutions engaged already in the conservation and management of the natural
resources in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). Mission plans to effectively
network such institutions with common and shared objectives, co-sharing of
resources and co-generation of processes leading to ecologically sustainable
development. `,

  `Primary objective of the mission is to develop in a time bound manner a
sustainable National capacity to continuously assess the health status of the
Himalayan Ecosystem and enable policy bodies in their policy-formulation
functions and assist States in the Indian Himalayan Region with their
implementation of actions selected for sustainable development. This would
call for suitable learning systems for balancing changes in eco system with
responsible human actions. National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Eco
system will adopt different approaches for building various capacities. `,

  `Capacity to capture, store and apply knowledge relating to the vulnerability and
changes in the Himalayan eco system over extended periods of time requires
specially trained man power and expertise. The National Mission for Sustaining
the Himalayan Eco system will focus on the creation of human capacities in the
areas relating to sustaining the Himalayan ecosystem, About 100 professionals
and experts in the area will be trained. Minimum of 25 well trained glaciologists
will become available for research and development and inputs for policy studies.`,

  `National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan ecosystem will build institutional
systems with long term memories and organizational structures for long term
observations, studies, understanding and forewarning of changes in the
Himalayan eco system. Two pronged approaches are planned. There are a large
number of knowledge institutions and community based organizations which are
already engaged in various aspects relating to the sustenance of the Himalayan
eco system. They are currently working in a non-coordinated manner with sub
critical resources. The National Mission will achieve a) better coordination among
such knowledge institutions and b) build new institutions in areas of knowledge
gaps in a time bound manner. Both virtual knowledge networks and real
knowledge institutions are planned. The National Center for Himalayan
Glaciology will undertake both intra mural research and support Extra Mural
Research in other knowledge institutions. Similarly institutional capacities in the
areas of traditional knowledge systems, Himalayan agriculture, eco tourism and
biodiversity will be built. `,

  `The challenge of adapting to climate change requires a coordinated response
from the Union Government and governments of the Himalayan States. This will
require a regular and focused dialogue among these States as well as the Union
Government. The National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Eco system will
establish a platform for a periodical dialogue among the various stake holders.
The dialogue will focus on the elaboration of a comprehensive and practical
strategy appropriate to the current immediate and long-term challenge involved in
sustaining a fragile eco system. These strategies may include management of
the Himalayan river-basins, cooperation in water resources management to
adapt to climate change, the promotion of sustainable agriculture and industrial
development in the Himalayan region. Governance systems will need to select
the most sustainable path of human development without endangering a fragile
ecosystem. Coordinated responses are required between the Central and Sate
Governments and this aspect will be covered directly by the Prime Ministerâ€™s
office. `,

  `An apex knowledge body with capacity to study and evolve strategies for
sustaining the Himalayan eco system will be developed and established during
the 12th plan period.The apex knowledge institution will develop strong linkages
with virtual knowledge networks, community based organizations and engage in
  regional cooperation, while undertaking research on developmental policy
studies. `
